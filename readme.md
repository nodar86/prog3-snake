**Snake / Basics of programming 3 homework**

This is actually a full-blown 2D grid-based Game Engine.
It can play any game as long as you provide the correct entities,
that perform the tick-based gamelogic.

Initial entity setup is done in Game.java I recommend you start from there when
exploring the code, but I will maybe write a guide to allow you to create games
with this. This was made as a school project so it's nothing professional.
